<p>IF this voice doesn’t talk the whole day... same things will happen the whole day.</p>

<p>Who is that person that its tense 24/7</p>

<p>I’m hypnotized</p>

<p>THE NICEST VACATION YOU’VE EVER HAD.</p>

<p>The concept of vacation.</p>

<p>Even the concept of meditation</p>

<p>I somehow ended up with a mess for an inner roommate.</p>

<p><a class="autolink" href="https://Rologs.com">Rologs.com</a> my logs with my inner roommate.</p>

<p>This guy is a neurotic, sensitive, almost schizophrenic person, keeps his own body clenched in anxiety, he is sensitive to all the what ifs around him. He always felt incomplete, he has lived with the idea that there is a moment in the future that he will feel complete, that one day he will feel useful, all his life is moving to that moment, but the problem is, that moment is indescribable, has never been defined.
He will always feel inadequate, he never fits. Money helped him to force his way and keep this view alive, he really believed this was the way to live.
He even hold his breath, in anxiety. He always believed that there is another witness of his life, there is no one, it’s just me and my roommate here.</p>

<p>Being objective, it’s quite clear that this person has created patters that are not logical. For example, he thinks that he is better than his own coach, when in reality he is struggling just to exist. How can he think this? </p>

<p>I should made a list of things that are illogical. What is illogical about it? I’m a dysfunctional, what is dysfunctional about it? </p>

<p>I’m destroying my body. What is destroying? I’m in eternal anxiety, the air this person breath is anxiety, he is fucking tired of waking up on this tension. 24/7</p>

<p>It has become his daily life that he doesn’t see it, he is so unaware of it that he just ignores it. But the pain doesn’t go.</p>

<p>The pain.
The whole idea of failure.</p>

<p>It feels quite clear that there are other paths. Other ways of living.</p>

<p>This is not the only way to live this.</p>

<p>I don’t have to show to Christine that I’m improving.</p>

<p>I should be able to breathe, and do it for that vacation I haven’t had.</p>

<p>That person goes to bed and zone out watching YouTube videos and detach from reality, because the idea of “wasting time” is so hurtful, it’s a way to avoid the feeling of failure.</p>

<p>I need to open this, dissect it, and logically set all the pro and cons and have a logical discussion with my roommate.</p>

<p>First, hey, i understand why you have been doing this. You did this as a way to create a cocoon, a place where you are not judged by wasting time. </p>

<p>This roommate still has not understood that coaching is for him. </p>

<p>“My mind should been thinking something else, not this confusion.”</p>

<p>When this roommate lose his train of thought, there is anxiety. When in reality, nothing has ever happened if a train of thought is lost. The anxiety is unfounded.</p>

<p>I should make a list of pattern and counter pattern. An agreement with the roommate. A honest one.</p>

<p>If he is still not convinced that change is needed, there is nothing I can do to change. He needs to be onboard with this. He needs to BELIEVE that a change will bring benefits to him.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t believe on it, why we just don’t try? You already got your wya for 30 years. What if for 1 year, you let other take control?. Just one month, release that fist. Open your hand, pass the control to other. Just sit. Here. Nothing bad will happen. Seriously. If you had relaxed or become schyzofrenic, everything in the world would have happened anyway, the power you think you have its only valid inside of you. I’m, not challenging you, I’m just talking for what i have seen all these years. </p>

<p>Ok now, listen to me, it’s time. I’m not asking for a big change. I’m just asking for small changes, i want you to believe this is the best for us. I want you to breathe, and stop.</p>

<p>Hey, nobody cares, you are not THAT important, and I’m not saying it to make you feel small, I’m saying it so you can liberate from this anxiety.</p>

<p>OK LETS MAKE THE PATTERN/ COUNTER PATTERN LIST.</p>

<p>I own the voice an answer. `</p>

<p>“My job isn’t to know who I am. My job is to make space for who I am”</p>

<p>“It’s not the notes you play, it’s the notes you play after” </p>

<p>Maybe its good idea to recognize how that my neurotic inner voice is the most important voice, that voice its not me. I give the power of attention, but it’s up to me to give him that power.</p>

<p>I need to reread all this and clean up the Pattern list.</p>

<p>The mental melodrama.</p>

<p>I like this book, because there is no fluffiness... no nice talking (Cory), no feeling of being manipulated with nice words.</p>

<p>You do this as though your life depended on it, because it does. As it is right now, your life is not your own; it belongs to your inner roommate, the psyche.I have to take it back.</p>

<p>I have to do the exercise of “Who you are”</p>

<p>If you are the one who is looking at something, that something is not you.</p>

<p>So what happened is that i deviated in a path that was not walked before, a path of ultimate search of purpose. It was a dangerous path, but now I’m coming back to the main road, the road of “mundane” things. And now I’m wiser, stronger, more resilient, and now i understand that i need to be more careful on what i give energy to.</p>

<p>Without awareness of being, or consciousness, there is nothing.</p>

<p>I’m grateful for my awareness.</p>

<p>Effortless. That is a key word.</p>

<p>The money and the energy of identity can kept alive the delusion of purpose. Once my identity and money got challenged everything collapsed, the foundation was empty.</p>

<p>EFFORTLESS</p>

<p>NO EGO</p>

<p>There is a pattern of believing there is a “right mentality way of living”. And that I will find out by thinking harder. In reality I could have not thinking anything and most of my life would had happened anyway. </p>

<p>That is your true home.</p>

<p>“You are lucid”</p>

<p>Consciousness </p>

<p>THIS MOMENT is always the right moment to improve that 10%. I fact the moments that don’t look ideal, are the ideal moments to do the 10% shift, because the sense of being in automatic mode its the seed of being unaware.</p>

<p>My inner show.</p>

<p>My number one source of anxiety is the lack of control of the inner voice. The inner voice “needs to be engaged”. My breath is not effortless, it feels that I’m making an effort to breath.</p>

<p>That sensation that I don’t have control over my inner voice. That this moment is dysfunctional, there is effort to change this moment. There is no peace, why do I think that peace is not the ultimate goal? There is a patter to think that just by “being” you are not “doing” and by “not doing” you are not “achieving” anything.</p>

<p>Its OVERWHELMING </p>

<p>The sensory input is overwhelming.</p>

<p>I have a pattern of thinking that there are moments more important than others, my roommate says “ no no, this moment needs my full attention, you can’t use this moment to change”, when in reality “EVERY” moment is a moment for shift.</p>

<p>I have to accept that the “melodramatic” doesn’t help. But the truth is that you can go a bit faster.</p>

<p>A realization that the bombarding is always going to be, how strong am I to handle the bombarding? What tools do I have to have a strong Psyche?</p>

<p>How do you make a stronger Psyche?</p>

<p>Maybe the approach of thinking meditation is the answer is not a complete answer. You need to have a resilient Psyche??? Do you need to train the self?</p>

<p>Or not?</p>

<p>“The roommate get disturbed with the mushroom” is it? Or is the awareness as well?</p>

<p>Its clear the I have a lot of concepts that I say, but in reality I don’t believe. And some other that I believe and I don’t say.</p>

<p>I order to create a plan, I need to get control over the things that I have control over.</p>

<p>There is simply you watching the dance of they psyche.</p>

<p>I was a kid that received a big ego and money.</p>

<p>You are fighting with creation, and that’s the most frightening thing in your life.</p>

<p>“The answer is, fear says so. The part of you inside that’s not okay with itself can’t face the natural unfolding of life because it’s not under your control.”</p>

<p>“Zone outs” are valid moments, these moments were created when nobody wanted to listen to me, not even myself, its a overreaction of “nobody listen to me”, and it is self-sabotage, destructive in a way to bring attention but its just a dysfunctional way, Today I decide to give it importance to the zone outs, to sit with awareness on these moments and to listen to the roommates on these moments. No friction, no anxiety, no neurotic behavior, just sit, in the zone out, I’m here with you. Breathing without judging. You are my mate, I’m here. Wherever you want, I’m here.</p>

<p>It’s ok, I’m here. I’m here with you. Life is happening around you, creation, your thoughts are independent. You can relax them or stress them, you can be effortless, or you can hold your breath and think you are protecting something.</p>

<p>In reality the fear is unsubstantiated, it’s just an illusion of control.</p>

<p>Currently I’m trying to get rid of the blockages that doesn’t make logical sense, but it seems that I will have to get rid of blockages that make logical sense too.</p>

<p>You can look deep within yourself, to the core of your being, and decide that you don’t want the weakest part of you running your life.</p>

<p>I jump because there is a thorn in my nervous system.</p>

<p>I’m a human with thorns all over me. But relax, it’s ok... all the thorns can go away... one at a time.</p>

<p>I have been protecting myself with devices of delusions of control and knowledge</p>

<p>How is that I never heard about this book? This book seems so random... I has never been in my radar............... WHY??? Why there is logical knowledge just random around me? How is possible that even after 47 years I need someone else to tell me what to read??</p>

<p>It seems fucking BASIC KNOWLEDGE that it hurts that it has existed around me and never considered?????</p>

<p><strong>you’re not going to get involved in your own melodrama.</strong></p>

<p>I think would be better to label the fears, the patterns created by those fears, and a mantra on how I can just LET THAT FEAR ACTIONS BE. No judgment, no involvement, no participation.</p>

<p>All are sources of pain</p>

<p>The process is as follows:
Feel the disturbance (anxiety, pain, hold your breath, hollowness, or a dropping sensation in the heart):
Inner thorns are simply blocked energies from the past that can be released.
Identify the fear of their inner thorns, the inner thorn is a reflection of the fear that is kept, notice that I noticed, take out the thorn, liberation. </p>

<p>How?
go. If you don’t get absorbed in it, the experience will soon pass and something else will come up. Just enjoy all of it. If you can do this, you will be free, and a world of pure energy will open up within you.</p>

<p>I created a whole apparatus around my fears, thorns, that allowed me to go anywhere.</p>

<p>The quality of awareness changes when I put my glasses .. the details make the real world more engaging...</p>

<p>Mundane. </p>

<p>Change, it doesn’t have a specific time</p>

<p>I don’t want to suffer anymore, I have decided that I don’t want to suffer anymore, suffering has been the water in the ocean that I live in. I don’t know anything outside of this ocean, but luckily (?) I got a glimpse of it and that has created a chaos on my apparent controlled existence.</p>

<p>An animal was eating the pizza today. Zero awareness of what is happening.</p>

<p>I’m having the most mundane day today, just fucking mundane, there is nothing special about it, according to my roommate. However there is a small shift, a realization that THIS mundane moment its the essential fabric of some kind of shift. If I can shift this mundane moment and be aware of it and RELEASE it, just if...</p>

<p>Transform any act into meditation</p>

<p>The birds. Again the birds.</p>

<p>There is no reason to write anything of this. It’s just a rambling chaos, a mix of crying, jaw clenching, neck cracking, a lot of breath being hold and a humming in my head like electricity.</p>

<p>The coffee make it worse, probably, but I drink it anyway.</p>

<p>This dysfunctional energy always existed in me, but I controlled it by channeling in destructive ways.</p>

<p>There is soul in this performance, it’s not about the lyrics, it’s the majority of muslims singing in harmony, it goes just through my filter directly to my heart, the naked humming of their voice. It’s an collective ohm that transcends meanings and words. What is this energy about?</p>

<p><a class="autolink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuNtLryOBAc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuNtLryOBAc</a></p>

<p>“We spend so much of our lives trying to find meaning, we keep trying to add more words, to figure out, analyze it, understand it. Yet what we once believed so strongly to be true, ends up being proven completely false.”</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I was close to be authentic, music showed up as a way to bypass filters, it just go straight to the heart.</p>

<p>Does it takes time to shift?</p>

<p>I fantasize that you found out the reason of my problems, I fantasize that the shift will be instantaneous, that will be like a M session, boom, aha, that’s it !. I fantasize, and I have the sense that there is not a honest thought behind that fantasy. There is a deep ego involved. It’s like the roommate knows something, its like he has been behind all this from the beginning, it doesn’t make sense but I feel the dishonesty behind the fantasy.</p>

<p>Surrender is starting to have a different meaning. The surrender requested is not dependent on the results of that surrounding. It’s a surrender of the results, if the authentic flow is chaotic then, let it be chaotic, if there is no resolution, no answer, if there is no closure, if there is not concept, if there is no “eureka” moment.... if there is more pain, more confusion, more unexpected results, then accepting that it is that way is the honest authentic surrender, a completely let go.</p>

<p>Why happened what happened? Why the depression? Why now? It’s a beaten up psyche, 40 years of playing a game of impossible tasks, I’m tired. My body and my psyche don’t want more of this, they want change as much as me. But they don’t know anything, the body only knows how to express pain, and the psyche how to express fear. And now, at 47 years old, they can’t hold this any longer, but at the same time they don’t know what they don’t know, its chaotic, the neurotic behavior its exploding, both KNOW that something needs to be done and they think they still can do something about it... that’s why it collapse like this, its a deep scream, a deep cry for help a state of maximum effort, thinking that the impossible can be possible with the body and the mind.</p>

<p>The natural state of the authentic been is effortless.</p>

<p>I need to solve my relationship with the concept of money</p>

<p>My roommate is not being honest, he has my time in compartments, he sits en the controlling chair and hijack my awareness... like if there is other time for the change. Its like I can be aware just when I focus on that,,, but this doesn’t make sense, it’s always, its a continuous truth.</p>

<p>My psyche doesn’t really think something its wrong all the time. Its just some times, my psyche sometimes looks peaceful, zoned out, sitting there eating, healthy, but in reality its the same dysfunctional psyche, he just want to hijack this moment and make me think that everything is fine. It’s not.</p>

<p>This mundane moment is where he sits and get stronger, and get tranced and doesn’t allow any shift, any awareness.</p>

<p>Awareness needs to enter these spaces, every moment, the mundane moments, all moments.</p>

<p>What if, for one day, I don’t listen to anything that comes from the voice of my psyche? What would really happen?</p>

<p>I’m okey with the flow of today.</p>

<p>The problem I see is that the whole narrative of my psyche is neurosis, I don’t see any moment of a relaxed voice, it’s always in full anxiety, always, even losing the train of thought creates anxiety. So I don’t know what “just don’t listen” my mind really means.</p>

<p>A morning mantra: I’m not the neurotic mind, I just watch it, I don’t interfere with his chaos, has ever been a full logical state where the mind shut up? No, never.
So, disengage, watch it from your consciousness seat. Watch your jaw, your unstable shallow breath, the ever present sense that something is wrong, like a cloud.</p>

<p>THERE IS ALWAYS A EVER PRESENT SENSE THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG. Be witness of it. </p>

<p>During my last Vipassana I had a vision of a kid in two different scenarios, a kid that its himself in front of a mirror playing an harmonica piano. And another one walking in the street crying silently, clenching his jaw and boiling hate.</p>

<p>Music makes my psyche anxious, it overpower it, there is no train of thought, the energy of the music create a disturbance in the reign of control of my psyche.</p>

<p>Today’s music is formulaic, boxed in western influences, 12 EDO, chord progressions, I don’t know what is music for. What is the purpose of?</p>

<p>The birds, the birds.</p>

<p>The truth is I always thought that by torturing my mind I would be able to squeeze the best of it.</p>

<p>My psyche is involved in this awakening, so I’m not sure what to do, because the roommate voice is labeling everything that is happening, is filtering it.</p>

<p>Voy a bajarlo en español</p>

<p>January 16, 2025. 12:00 midday</p>

<p>Isabelle asked me to meet her in Wat else cafe but it was closes, we crossed inside Garden Village which is a basic guesthouse in Funky Lane. There was not much introduction, she asked me what do I know about energy, so I didn’t have time to collect my thoughts, I was not expecting a question like that.</p>

<p>I tried to explain that I’m currently very sensitive, very aware of how much I have been holding, blocking some type of “energy” and how much confusion is in my psyche. I mentioned quickly how I went to Christine with what I thought was a “burn out” due to work, but my expectations were that the solution to my problems were simple. However, since the first time I met Christine, I felt something else was going on, I talked and talked, and causally and unconsciously mentioned the word “authentic”, she then talked and just repeated the word “Authenticity”... and it blowed my mind...</p>

<p>I never thought about that word in reference to me.</p>

<p>And after the first M session, instead of things got clear, everything got way way more confusing than I ever been. It’s like my ego and desire of purpose exploding to the maximum, it’s like my psyche got validated.</p>

<p>She stopped me, and realized that she was not really paying attention to my words, she just said. “What I see is an ancestor awakening”.</p>

<p>And I couldn’t contain the holding, I cried there, I haven’t even mentioned anything related with mysticism, because its too confusing, however she opened to door to talk about the vision of the Native American in my own body, I mentioned how he straightened my spine, and how shocked I was, and then the first time the sense of “intuition” at the base of my spine. And the sense of “arrogance” coming from him, however I immediately doubt if this was real arrogance? Or just a level of confidence that I have never had? It was easy to challenge if it was a “bad” arrogance.</p>

<p>Once I start talking about this, I cried more, I mentioned that he is a musician, but a type of musician that understands frequencies and cycles, and many more topics.</p>

<p>I told Isabelle, that at the beginning it gave me a sense that “purpose its around the corner” however, it was really not the case, I went in to a deeper spiral and my ego got stronger than ever.</p>

<p>I crossed eyes to Isabelle, again, she is not really listening my words, she just say, what you need is to connect with nature, and I agree.</p>

<p>Then she looks with compassion and said with love: Just let it go.</p>

<p>I’m very confused, the words, are there, but I don’t know what to “do”</p>

<p>I started a phrase and casually mentioned the word “but” and I stopped and I said that this word “but” is the problem, right there, my psyche always has a “but” that doesn’t let things go.</p>

<p>I tried to stop talking, and she invited me to her workshop on Saturday </p>

<p>We are an aperture were the universe can observe itself.</p>

<p>I feel that acknowledge that there is something more than my psyche its to give energy to it.</p>

<p>There is NOTHING that my psyche needs to be fixed. Not even my addictions, thinking that I need to make an effort to change it it’s what give them energy. You want to do it.... Doooooo iiiiittttttt... but now, be witnessing and be amazed of being witness of the doing.</p>

<p>ABUNDANCE </p>
