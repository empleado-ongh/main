El Salvador 2-July

6-Jul

The idea is to write. I don’t know how to write.  I don’t know what to write here. I feel it takes effort to put ideas together and I’m doing this without effort. 

Anyway. The idea is to write. I’m in the church Genesareth, this is a my church from childhood. 

If I’m going to write, I should write with some objective in mind.  Probably the most obvious objective is to write something that can be fed to an AI as context. 

The better and more complete context, the outputs of an AI would be better. 

So let’s start with that idea first.  

Context for AI.

I should consider to work for a Real Estate company in El Salvador. 

To get first-hand knowledge of real estate es the most important task. 

How can I make $5,000 in sale and rental commissions?  What’s the business case behind?

What companies are profitable?  What is the business case behind a successful Real Estate business in El Salvador?
